#This code really ...

isn't for taking it serious or studying it, it's too quick'n'dirty spaghetti ...

Nevertheless, I was playing around with a Karaoke idea, a small present for my ex father in law.

It's one of my first React apps as well :)


Basically ...

* I used Bitwig to cancel out the voice of a CLI downloaded youtube song as good as I could (echo/reverb remaining)
* I googled the lyrics and step by step created a json denoting karaoke-needed entry/leave points of verses
* Whilst playing the mp3 via Web Audio API I googled quickly for a basic d3 animation and added an svg spectrum visualization
* Whilst being playing around I made up a small canvas visualization with circles driven by spectrum data as well
